<p><em>double densed uncounthest hour of allbleakest age with a bad of
wind and a barrel of rain</em> is an in-progress piece for resonators
and brass. I’m keeping a composition log here as I work on it.</p>
<p>As of March 2025, I’m writing about other things here too.</p>

<p>One of the early choices in pippi was the question of how to deal
with different types of buffer abstractions. The earliest versions of
pippi followed the design of the python standard library: all buffers
were just byte strings. [0] That was a really cool choice for the python
2 era. String manipulation even then in python was actually pretty fast,
but more importantly the facilities for slicing and dicing strings in
pure python were very ergonomic. Even though 16 bit stereo audio had to
be packed across 2 bytes and 2 samples and it was easy to slice into a
sound string in the wrong place and blow up the audio in fun ways, with
some helper functions to slice in the right places it was actually
pretty nice for doing microsound work.</p>
<h3 id="natively-microsound">Natively microsound</h3>
<p>That was the start of an obsession, since I found reasoning about
microsound composition in unit-generator environments difficult to the
point of driving me to want to create a system based around python’s
comfortable string slicing and dicing interfaces. [1]</p>
<h3 id="abstraction-is-tough">Abstraction is tough</h3>
<p>Abstraction is a hard balance to strike. Bags of bytes like python’s
byte strings (or an array of chars in C, whatever) are simple and
flexible, but the noise in usage can build up enough that it makes sense
to add a layer of abstraction on top. For example, python bytes strings
already embed their lengths. That small convenience makes a bigger
difference to expressiveness than it might seem. Carrying around a
length in a side channel (now every element of the composition has two
parts to manage) manually everywhere in a composition is more
error-prone and tedious than embedding that value in the string itself.
Knowing that new substrings extracted from a string will have their
lengths updated correctly without having to think about it lets you
worry more about the things that matter, rather then dealing with
bookkeeping issues.</p>
<p>So, it was that mindset that led me to create three basic types in
pippi exposed at the python level: <code>SoundBuffer</code> for
unbounded multi-channel sounds, <code>Wavetable</code> for
single-channel / linear / flat data that was also symmetrically
unbounded (in other words, signals from -whatever to +whatever
oscillating around a zero point like you’d use in a wavetable osc) and
<code>Window</code> for single-channel / linear / flat data with bounds
between 0 and 1, useful for windowing functions, etc.</p>
<p>It seemed like a nice idea to be able to check the type of some
buffer to know its contents, and fill buffers simply by saying things
like <code>sine</code> or <code>tri</code> knowing that a
<code>sine</code> argument to a <code>Wavetable</code> constructor would
produce a full period of a sinewave, while the <code>Window</code>
constructor would simply use the first half.</p>

<h3 id="simplifying">Simplifying</h3>
<p>A decade later, I’ve changed my mind. It’s a big refactoring project,
but I think the next step for buffers in pippi is to simply collapse
everything into <code>SoundBuffer</code>s, and provide nice interfaces
for filling them with the sorts of data needed, and doing basic
introspection on their contents as needed.</p>
<p>For example, nothing about the above interfaces in pippi need to
change, the <code>dsp.wt</code> and <code>dsp.win</code> routines would
simply return a single channel <code>SoundBuffer</code> filled in the
appropriate way rather than a special <code>Window</code> or a
<code>Wavetable</code> type. There were already some basic introspection
options on the old buffers, but the new buffers have a slightly more
expanded set allowing a simple way to get the minimum, maximum, average,
magnitude (absolute value maximum, useful for symmetric signals), etc as
needed.</p>
<h3 id="from-numpy-ndarrays-to-lpbuffer_t">From numpy ndarrays to
<code>lpbuffer_t</code></h3>
<p>Last night I clobbered my way through the last parts of a related
(and larger) refactoring project I’ve been working on for years. I
wasn’t expecting to get as far on it as I did, but found myself
barreling through and ripping out the old buffers finally. Pippi
<code>SoundBuffer</code>s are now backed by libpippi
<code>lpbuffer_t</code> structs, which are both simpler and also have a
few extra slots for metadata to make using them like ringbuffers, etc a
little easier. They’re exposed to python through the buffer protocol and
a reworked version of the cython class interface of the previous
numpy-backed buffers. [2]</p>
<p>In C-land, libpippi <code>lpbuffer_t</code> buffers are already the
main data structure for all sound buffers. There is an internal
<code>lparray_t</code> for integer bags, and a concept of “stacking”
buffers that I haven’t really settled on a final version of yet, but
<code>lpbuffer_t</code> is the primary data structure for almost
everything. Since the new <code>SoundBuffer</code>s in pippi all use the
libpippi routines, collapsing the <code>Wavetable</code> and
<code>Window</code> abstractions into them should be more
straightforward than trying to do this with the older buffers, where all
transformations were more specialized across the three types.</p>
<h3 id="getting-there">Getting there</h3>
<p>The major projects in this next refactor are basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add all the interfaces unique-to-wavetables-and-windows into the
<code>SoundBuffer</code>s, for example <code>skew()</code> which does
phase distortion.</li>
<li>Finish adding all the older cython built-in wavetables and window
types to libpippi. (I’ve only implemented a core set of basic types, but
one day into using the new interface I already really miss the more
esoteric built-in shapes.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is never a good time for these projects… but since I’m already
cleaning up this larger refactor over the weekend, I think this is
probably the right time to take a moment to work on wavetables / windows
again too. I hope I can finish it all before the fall, when I have a few
musicing things planned. Pippi is more crashy again right now, but still
stable enough for jazz. I’d like to smooth the edges over more
significantly this summer though.</p>

<p>[0] Or put another way, since this was the python 2 era where all
strings were byte strings – meaning one character simply equals one 8
bit byte, and all strings are C-like sequences of raw bytes or ASCII
chars, rather than one character being a unicode code point made up
potentially of several bytes)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] Some years later I read <a href="https://www.hnishino.info/">Hiroki Nishino</a>’s <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/unit-generators-considered-harmful-for-microsound-synthesis.pdf?c=icmc&amp;format=pdf&amp;idno=bbp2372.2013.018"><em>Unit-generators
considered harmful (for microsound synthesis)</em></a> and felt way less
alone on this journey!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[2] In other words, in python it should be relatively simple to mix
and match numpy arrays and pippi <code>SoundBuffer</code>s. This has
always been possible because internally the older buffers exposed a
<code>frames</code> property which was just the raw numpy array, but it
was fairly clunky in practice and required some more manual work. The
driving force behind that project was to reduce copies (libpippi buffers
can be shared with C threads more easily without copies) and make the
numpy dependency for the project optional. That also shows the age of
this refactoring project: when I started, installing numpy was a
legitimately difficult thing to do in many environments. The situation
has changed for the better though! I don’t feel the need to ditch numpy
entirely anymore, really. Still the tweaks to the
<code>SoundBuffer</code> interface that came out of this refactor are a
step in the right direction, I think.</p>
